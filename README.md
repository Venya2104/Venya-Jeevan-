## Profil et Connaissances

### Présentation Personnelle

//Décrivez en quelques phrases vos objectifs à cours terme et long terme si vou en avez : 

I've been more of a artist than a designer my entire life. As a contemporary art pratice major back home in India and then coming to ESAD as a Digital Art and Design student was a challenge and an experiment that I absolutely looked forward to and its been amazing so far. 

In short term I am currently looking to expand my knowledge in the 3D space, web deisgn and Graphic Design. Blender, Unity, Figma, Midjourney, Unreal engine and everything else has been a very new experience. I want to get indepth knowledge and up my skillset with these softwares. I also want to delve deep into design studies and design theories. I want to experiment with Illustrator and Photoshop and gain a deep knowledge of design studies in general and find my design practice. 

In long term I want to be able to run my own art and design studio. I don't have an complete idea but I do have an outline, I want to run my own design agency and at the same time have my own art studio for printmaking and painting. I want to live as an artist and designer while managing my responsisbilites back home.

## Projet et Thématique de Recherche

# Projet 1

### A Text Based Game with Twine

- **WHOOPS YOU GOT KILLED!**   
- **Whoops You Got Killed, is a text based non linear, choice based game. It is about a out of context plot which takes you through a journey where you get killed randomly depending on the choice you make. Throughout the story there are various choices that you can make but only one of the choices will take you to the end of the story after you finish a quest. It is a unserious fun plot and its made to go at a fast phase.** 

### Thématiques de Recherche

- **Quick and simple , questional but attention grabbing short stories. Unfiltered and uncensored kind of humour.**   
- **Well I chose this genre of story to work with because my mind flows freely when I am coming up with things like this. My usual calculated, thought out planning process is juxtoposed when I am able to just get in there and start building something and see where it goes, instead of deciding a end result and then working on it. The fact that I didn't have to have everything figure out in the beginning itself helped me stay sane.** 

## Twine and CSS

- **Being very new to digital sofware and even newer to code this was something that kept my interest in learning going. I love figuring out things that are new to me, that I am not good at yet so it was plus.**   
- **I learned to format my story with CSS, I have basic understanding of basic codes, all of which I didnt't end up using for creating this game, My got to learn in none the less.** 

## Références Artistiques

- **I think personally for me, the relevance is that I got to understand how code works, how linking files and sources works. Its a game that is laid back, fun and out of the box wack. It is something that can come in very handy to play just to get a breather and unwind.**   
- **I got to now an insane amount of game creators through this project, I think my favorite rght now should be Pipin Bar and creaters from crows crows crows. The temple of no was the biggest inspiration for this project. I would have played that game atleast 7 times to understand the creation of it better.**

# Journal de bord


**I. WRITING STORY AND MAKING A BASIC FLOWCHART IN FIGMA:**

**The story is in first person narrative with a bit of fourth wall breaking. It starts with soemone living near a beach and taking a walk where they find three objects. Each of the choices lead to different scenerios but only one leads to a quest in space where majority of the story takes place. It has a peculiar yet a fun way of getting across messages and points. Some comments of world politics and overall the most random experience you can have.**

**II. PUTTING ALL THE TEXT IN TWINE:**

This was a fun step where I got to see the game come to life little by little. I added all the choices, connected all the passages, made required changed to text and then the basic skeleton and foundation was ready.
